###  What is implemented:
* Build a todo list single page application.
* Add/Edit/Delete todo items
* Mark todo item as done
* Ability to filter items in the todo list
                          
###  These points are presented

* JS code unit tests
* Modular Angular code 
* Dependency injection 

###  Some gloabal variables for colors are used:                 

* Some basic styling with SASS. It would be nice if you can demonstrate how to write modular SCSS code
